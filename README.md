# HMM, Forward-Backward algorithm, Viterbi algorithm, Python, iPython, Numpy
Hi, I am Junyi
I Implemented the forward-backward algorithm and Viterbi algorithm to solve two commen Hidden Markov Model(HMM) problems with python (ipython):
1)Find the model lamda=(A,B,p) given an observation sequence O and dimensions N and M.
2)Find the hidden state sequence given an observation sequence O and model lamda=(A,B,p)

This implementation is based on Mark Stamp's A Revealing Introduction to Hidden Markov Models (Department of Computer Science, San Jose State University)
