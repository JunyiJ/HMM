# HMM, Forward-Backward algorithm, Python
Hi, I am Junyi
I Implemented the forward-backward algorithm for Hidden Markov Model(HMM) with python to solve the following problem:
Find the model lamda=(A,B,p) given an observation sequence O and dimensions N and M.

This implementation is bsed on Mark Stamp's A Revealing Introduction to Hidden Markov Models (Department of Computer Science, San Jose State University)
